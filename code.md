Raster Images are made up of a rectangular grid of pixels. Each pixels color is specified by a number of bits.

Most commonly used for:

1. Computer displays
2. Image storage

Computer displays, also referred to as bitmapped displays because each pixel on the screen is a small number of bits in memory.

Raster images are **resolution dependent**. Meaning that the images cannot be scaled up to a higher resolution without a loss of quality.

Raster images are most commonly generated in software tools like MS Paint and Adobe Photoshop and will often be saved in file formats that include JPEG, PNG, and GIF among others.


# Vector Image Graphics

Vectors are computer graphic images that are defined by 2D points, connected by lines and curves to form shapes.

Each 2D point has a single position along an x and y axis. Unlike Raster images, Vector graphics can be scaled up without a loss in resolution.

Paths in the image also contain info related to stroke color, thickness, bend, and fill.

The common file type now used for vector graphics is an SVG. This stands for **Scalable Vector Graphic**.
