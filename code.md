# Raster Images (Bitmap Images)

Raster Images are made up of a rectangular grid of pixels. Each pixels color is specified by a number of bits. This is called a **bitmap**, a digital image composed of a matrix of dots.

Most commonly used for:

1. Computer displays
2. Image storage (JPEG, PNG, ETC.)

Computer displays, also referred to as bitmapped displays because each pixel on the screen is a small number of bits in memory. Smartphones, digital cameras, along with computers, are where the raster image is predominantly encountered.

Raster images are **resolution dependent**. Meaning that the images cannot be scaled up to a higher resolution without a loss of quality.

Here is an image that shows this loss of quality as one part of the image was made larger.

Raster images are most commonly found in software tools like MS Paint and Adobe Photoshop and will often be saved in file formats that include JPEG, PNG, and GIF among others.


# Vector Image Graphics

Vectors are computer graphic images that are defined by 2D points, connected by lines and curves to form shapes.

Each 2D point has a single position along an x and y axis. Unlike Raster images, Vector graphics can be scaled up without a loss in resolution. This is possible because vector images are based within a mathematical structure.

Paths in the image also contain info related to stroke color, thickness, bend, and fill.

Vector graphics are commonly used to create logos, illustrations, and digital graphics.

Here is a short blog post on how to create a vector image with simple markup language: [Vector based graphics in HTML and CSS](http://www.callumhart.com/blog/vector-based-graphics-in-html-and-css)

It is also common practice to convert raster images into a vector so that the image can be scaled without the loss in resolution. Adobe Illustrator is used often for this purpose and a tutorial can be found here: [Click to navigate to tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaoBr7SzF-c)

The common file type now used for vector graphics is an SVG. This stands for **Scalable Vector Graphic**.
